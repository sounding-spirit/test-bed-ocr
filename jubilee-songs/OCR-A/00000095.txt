PROGRESS  A  T  FISK  UNIVERSITY. 
This  year  was  marked  by  several  events  of  special 
interest.  Hitherto  the  University  had  been  without 
a  President.  Its  work  had  been  outlined  and  guided 
in  its  general  features  by  the  American  Missionary 
Association.  It  was  felt  that  the  time  had  corne 
when  a  capable  President  should  take  charge  of  it, 
supported  by  a  fully-organised  faculty.  For  this 
place,  Rev.  E.  M.  Cravath,  M.A.,  was  the  unani¬ 
mous  first  choice  of  its  trustees  and  friends.  More 
than  any  one  else  he  had  had  the  responsibility  of 
its  establishment;  and,  during  his  subsequent  ser¬ 
vice  for  several  years  as  Field  Secretary  of  the 
Association,  the  burden  of  planning  its  work,  and 
providing  for  its  wants,  had  rested  chiefly  upon  him. 
He  had  piloted  it  through  a  sea  of  difficulties,  and 
to  him  it  owed  much  of  its  success.  Educated  at 
anti-slavery  Oberlin,  and  identified  all  his  life  with 
anti-slavery  effort,  he  was  felt  to  be  specially  adapted 
and  providentially  guided  to  the  place.  And  as  soon 
as  events  shaped  so  that  he  could  well  be  spared 
from  those  duties,  he  resigned  his  secretaryship  in 
the  Association  and  entered  upon  the  new  work. 
In  1875,  also,  the  University  graduated  its  first 
college  class.  It  had  taken  some  of  them,  ten  years 
before,  with  little  more  than  a  knowledge  of  the 
alphabet,  and  carried  them  through  extended  pre¬ 
paratory  studies  and  a  thorough  classical  course,  to 
the  point  where  a  rigid  examination  awarded  them 
the  degree  of  B.A.  At  graduation  one  was  chosen 
instructor  in  the  University,  and  others  found  re¬ 
sponsible  positions  awaiting  them  as  teachers  in  the 
City  Schools  at  Nashville  and  Memphis.  Two  were
