The  above  hymn  was  published  in  the  second  series  of  Charles  Wesley's  "Funeral  Hymns."  Mr  Wesley  was  born  in  1708  and  died  in  1788.  He  originally  balonged 
to  the  Cfturch  of  England,  but  with  his  brother  John,  in  connection  with  others,  established  the  English  Methodist  Church.  This  is  one  of  his  standard  hymns  among 
thousands  he  composed.  See  full  statement  in  reference  to  him  in  other  parts  of  this  book,  "Mr.  Wesley  composed  over  6.000  valuable  hymns,  He  was  one  of  the 
founders  of  Methodism,  which  has  proven  to  be  one  of  the  great  churches. 
The  Hymn  was  used  by  John  Wesley  when  he  preached  his  Bro.  Charles  Wesley's  funeral  See  History  of  Breedlove  under  tune  I  Am  Going  Home,  page  282  as 
well  as  other  tunes  of  him  in  this  song  book.
