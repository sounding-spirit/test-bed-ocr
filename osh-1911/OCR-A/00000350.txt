home,  To  welcome  the  travellers  home,  To  welcome  the  travellers  home,  And  sing  hal-le-lu-jah  the  lou-der,  To  welcome  the  trav  -  el-ers  home 
4.  And  there  are  out  friends  and  companions, 
Escaped  from  the  evil  to  come, 
And  crowding  the  gates  of  fair  Zion, 
To  wait  our  arrival  at  home. 
5.  And  there  is  the  blessed  Redeemer, 
So  mild  on  bis  merciful  throne, 
With  hearts  and  hands  widely  extended, 
To  welcome  his  ransom'd  ones  home. 
6.  Then  let  us  go  onward  rejoicing, 
Till  Jesus  invites  us  to  come, 
To  share  in  his  glorious  kingdom, 
And  rest  in  his  bosom  at  home. 
These  words  were  composed  by  Rev.  S.  B.  Sawyer  on  the  day  of  his  death,  with  request  that  this  tune  should  be  published. 
The  air  of  thin  tune  is  one  of  the  old  national  melodies  of  America,  and  in  its  Seculor  form  it  was  called  "Old  Rosen  the  Bow.''  It  took  its  present  name,  "Saw- 
yers  Exit,''  from  Rev.  S.  B.  Sawyer.  The  words  of  the  tune  were  composed  by  him  on  the  day  of  his  death,  with  a  request  that  they  be  applied  to  the  melody  and 
published,  and  on  completing  the  words  his  spirit  took  its  eternal  flight  into  its  new  life.  Prof.  Massengale  applied  the  words  to  the  tune.  These  words  composed  by  this 
christian  man,  shows  the  glorious  and  triumphant  death  of  the  righteous.  See  numerous  sketches  of  John  Massagale  in  other  parts  of  this  volume.  We  have  no 
further  data  about  Mr.  Sawyer  than  the  above.  "3  Batt^
