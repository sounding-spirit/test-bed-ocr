Stephen  Jenks,  of  New  Canaan,  Conn.,  published  the  "  Delights  of  Harmony"  in  1805.  Twenty-six  of  the  tunes  in  this  book  were  composed  by  him,  and  the 
work  was  published  by  subscription.  He  removed  to  Thompson  and  died  there  in  1856.  He  was  a  ready  composer.  He  is  supposed  to  have  composed  the  words 
of  this  tune.
