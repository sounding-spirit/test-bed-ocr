1.  Soon  will  this  mor-tal  life  be  o'er,  This  bod-y  mould  -  er  in  -  to  dust:  Na  -  ked  my  soul  will  stand  before  A  God  that's  ho-ly,  pure  and  just. 
2.  its  standing  doom  of  bliss  or  woe,  Will  from  the  great  1  am  re-ceive;  Up  to  the  realms  of^glo-ry  go,  Or  in  hell's  torments  ev-er  live.
