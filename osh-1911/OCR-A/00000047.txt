Timothy  Swann  was  born  1758  in  Worcester,  Mass.,  died  in  Sheffield,  Conn.,  1842.  He  was  self-taught  in  music,  only  having  attended  a  course  of  studies 
for  three  weeks  in  a  country  singing  school  at  Groton.  When  he  was  sixteen  years  of  age  he  moved  to  Northfield,  Mass.  He  was  a  hatter  by  trade,  and  while 
engaged  in  this  business,  studied  music  for  over  thirty  years.  He  wrote  and  taught  music  in  New  England.  Many  of  his  tunes  were  published  and  had  wide 
circulation.  He  was  a  genius  in  his  way.  His  tunes  were  remarkable  for  their  originality,  and  singularly  unlike  any  other  melodies.  "  China"  is  one  of  his 
master-pieces,  and  illustrates  his  self-culture  in  the  art  of  song.  It  is  printed  in  song  books  of  Law,  Mason,  Billings,  Swann,  Holden.  In  the  "  Missouri  Har¬ 
mony,"  1837,  "Southern  Harmony,"  1835,  and  all  along  from  1807  up  to  the  present,  and  was  also  printed  in  the  Sacred  Harp,"  in  1844,  by  White  and  King. 
The  only  song  book  he  ever  published  was  "  The  New  England  Harmony,"  104  pages.
