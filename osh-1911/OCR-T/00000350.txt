4. And there are oui friends and companions, 5. And there is the blessed Redeemer, 6. Then let us go onward rejoicing,
Escaped from the evil to come, So mild on his merciful throne, Till Jesus invites us to come,

And crowding the gates of fair Zion, With hearts and hands widely extended, To share in his glorious kingdom,

To wait our arrival at home. To welcome his ransom'd ones home. And rest in his bésom at home.
