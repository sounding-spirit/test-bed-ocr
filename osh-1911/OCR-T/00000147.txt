Stephen Jenks, of New Canaan, Conn., published the “‘ Delights of Harmony” in 1805. Twenty-six of the tunes in this book were composed by him, and the
work was published by subscription. He removed to Thompson and died there in 1856. He was a ready composer. He is supposed to have composed the words
of this tune.
