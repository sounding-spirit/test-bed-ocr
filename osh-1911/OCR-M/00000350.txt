Escaped from the evil to come,
And crowding the gates of fair Zion,
To wait our arrival at home.

These words were composed by Rev. S. B. Sawyer on the day of his death, with request that this tune should be published.
The air of this tune is one of the old national melodies of America, and in its Seculor form it was called "Old Ro:en the Bow." It took its present name' "Saw-
yers Exit," from Rev. S. B. Sawyer. The words of the tune were composed by him on the day of his death, with a request that they be applied to the melody and
published, and on completing the yords his spirit took its eternal flight into its new life. Prof. Massengale applied the words to the tune. These words composed by this
christian man, shows the glorious and triumphant death of the righteous. See numerous sketches of John Massagale in other parts of this volume. We have no
further data about Mr. Sawyer than the above.
