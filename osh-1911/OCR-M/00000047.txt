Timothy Swann was born 1758 in Worcester, Mass., died in Sheffield, Conn., 1842. He was self-taught in music, only having attended a course of studies
for three weeks in a country singing school at Groton. When he was sixteen years of age he moved to Northfield, Mass. He was a hatter by trade, and while
engaged in this business, studied music for over thirty years. He wrote and taught music in New England. Many of his tunes were published and had wide
circulation. He was a genius in his way. His tunes were remarkable for their originality, and singularly unlike any other melodies. " China is one of his
master-pieces, and illustrates his self-culture in the art of song. It is printed in song books of Law, Mason, BillinFS, Swann, Holden. In the Missouri Har-
mony," 1837, " Southern Harmony," 1835, and all along from 1807 up to the present, and was also printed in the Sacred Harp," in 1844, by White and King.
The only song book he ever published was The New England Harmony," 104 pages.

The above hymn was found in " Mercer's Cluster," page 146, headed "Solemn Addresses to Young People." This is the third revised edition of said book.
Rev. Jesse Mercer of Howellton Ga. was the editor in 1823. The hymn has appeared in several hymn books, but none of them give the author's name or date of
the hymn. It is probably an English production.
