THIRD, MINOR
Third, minor. An interval measured by
three half-steps.
Third shift. The double shift in violin-
playing.
Thirteenth. An interval comprising an
octave and a sixth. It contains twelve
diatonic degrees, i.e., thirteen sounds.
Thirty-second note. A demisemiquaver,
Thirty-second rest. A rest, or pause,
equal to the length of a thirty-second
note,
Thorough bass. Figured bass; a system
of harmony which is indicated by a
figured bass. When there is no figure,
it is understood that the common
chord of such a note is to be used as
its harmony. The following table will
show the manner in which figures are
used :
The figure 2 implies a 4th and 6th,
a 5th perfect,
or diminished, according to the
position of the note in the key.
The figure 4 implies a 5th, or 5th and 8th.

3d and 5th.
A stroke through a figure directs the
raising of the interval by a natural, or
sharp, as the case may be. An acci-
dental standing alone implies a corre-
sponding alteration of the 3d of the
chord. Horizontal lines direct the con-
tinuance of the harmony of the pre-
vious chord. If there are no figures
under the previous chord, the line or
lines direct the continuance of the com-
mon chord of the first note under
which they were placed.
Three-eighth measure. A measure hav-
ing the value of three eighth notes,
marked I.
Three fold. A chord consisting of three
tones, comprising a tone combined
with its third and fifth.

TIERCE DE PICARDIE
clusive; these notes are expressed by
small letters, with three short strokes,
also thrice-accented octave, or three-lined
octave. See Tablature and Tempera-
ment.
Thumb-string. Melody-string of the
banjo.
Tie. A curved line placed over two or
more notes in the same position on the
stave :
The tie is also called a bind, and the
curved line, when used over notes repre-
senting different sounds, is called a slur..
(See Slur.) These notes need not be
written on the same degree of the staff,
(although they generally are) for in the
tempered scale (which see) the flat and
the sharp of two contiguous notes can
mean the same sound, and the follow-
ing would therefore be
an enharmonic tie :
If the two notes under the curved
line have dots above them, the
curved line is not a tie, but becomes.
a Portamento (demi-marcato) mark.
This is an example of such a mark
If the second note only, in such an
example, has a dot over it, the effect
would be that of a short slur. The fol-
lowing, therefore, would
be played as two notes,
the first receiving some degree of
accent, and the second being played
with lightness, and a little shorter than.

Tief (Ger.) (téf.) Deep, low, profound.
Tiefer (Ger.) (té-fÖr.) Deeper; lower ;.

de.) Tierce oj- Picardy; a term applied
in Germany to the notes between the
