FINGERING, AMERICAN
J. S. Bach. He introduced the thumb
freely, and used the fingers in a much
more modern style than his predeces-
sors. He did not, however, publish
any system of fingering, but contented
himself with teaching the system to
his sons and other pupils.
In Philipp
Em. Bach's Versuch uber die wahre
Art das Klavier zu Spielen" (1753), this
system was first published. Neverthe-
less, there was published, in England, a
work on the same subject, which ante-
dates Bach's book. This is entitled
Pasquali's Art of Fingering, for the
Harpsichord." In this (which has the
numeration o, 1, 2, 3, 4), the thumb is as
freely used as in modern music. The
Italian masters undoubtedly aided the
advance in fingering, some of them
before the time of Philipp Em. Bach.
It will be seen from the above that the
so-called " American fingering began
in Germany, took root in England, and
was probably the earliest numeration of
the fingers. See English Fingering.

Virginal Book."
Fingering, American. The use of the
sign (x) to indicate the thumb in piano-
forte playing, in distinction from the
German or foreign fingering, in which
the thumb is called the first finger.
Fingering, foreign.
A method of fin-
Fingering, German. gering piano music
which designates the thumb as the first
finger.
Fingering, scale. The system of scale
fingering at present in use is found in
the works of Philipp Em. Bach. Vet
the principle of it is to be found in
some earlier Italian works. In the old
spinet and harpsichord works, and in
an old organ book of 1 571, the scale was
fingered (German fingering) as follows,
2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3— and in some
later methods
The earliest valuable system of scale
fingering gave the rule to pass the
thumb under on the first white key
after a black one, which is the basis
of our scale fingering to-day. This
would present such fingerings as fol-
lows (Pasquali's " Art of Fingering " ):
FIORÉTTI
But in the right hand, the fingering
very nearly followed our present sys-
tem. In modern scale fingering a few
recent theories may be mentioned. A
few German pedagogues have endea-
vored to change the accustomed fin-
gering so that the thumbs shall always
fall together, in both hands. This has
not as yet been accepted as an advan-
tageous change. As an advanced
study, in difficult fingering many
teachers, Rosenthal among
great
others, apply the fingering of the
C scale to many other scales. To
play the scale of D flat Nith the C scale
fingering is a task of some difficulty.
Some teachers are in favor of ending
each scale exercise with a slow trill on
the last two notes. This counteracts the
chief defect of scale practice. In scale
work the fingers 1, 2, and 3, have the
most work allotted to them ; the fourth
finger is less used, and the fifth least
of all. See Stainer & Barrett, and
Grove's Dictionary.
