Notation.  The  art  of  representing  tones 
by  written  or  printed  characters.  The 
earliest  fixed  system  was  that  of  the 
Greeks  (600  B.  C.),  which  used  the 
letters  of  the  alphabet,  both  complete 
and  fragmentary,  to  indicate  different 
pitches  and  intervals.  This  system, 
with  various  changes,  existed  well  into 
the  middle  ages.  In  the  earliest  part 
of  the  dark  ages  another  system  existed 
contemporaneously  with  the  employ¬ 
ment  of  letters  —the  neume  notation. 
In  the  neumes,  we  find  the  beginnings 
of  an  effort  to  appeal  to  the  eye  as  well 
as  to  the  thought.  The  chief  elements 
of  this  mode  of  notation  were  the  ver¬ 
tical  line  |  (called  virga),  the  dot  .  , 
and  the  horizontal  line  —  (called 
jacens  );  and  after  these,  came  the  up¬ 
ward  loop  -—,  called  (plica  ascendens), 
and  the  downward  loop  *-»,  (called 
plica  descendens),  besides  a  host  of 
other  similar  characters.  These  marks 
were  placed  directly  over  each  syllable  ; 
and  while  they  could  not  give  the  exact 
pitch  to  the  singer,  they  served  very 
well  to  show  the  direction  in  which  the 
voice  should  go,  and  also  indicated 
roughly  the  length  of  the  note.  They 
were,  in  short,  merely  a  leminder  to  the 
singer  of  the  progressions  of  a  melody 
which  he  had  learned  orally  ;  a  species 
of  musical  mnemonics.  The  letters  now 
underwent  a  modification.  A  major 
scale,  corresponding  to  the  diatonic 
scale,  which  we  begin  on  C,  was  repre¬ 
sented  by  the  letters  ABCDFFGA. 
This  was  afterwards  changed  to  repre¬ 
sent  a  minor  scale,  in  an  effort  to  bring 
it  more  in  consonance  with  the  old 
Greek  theory.  Odo,  of  Cluny,  is  cred¬ 
ited  with  making  this  reform  during  the 
tenth  century—our  present  letter  sys¬ 
tem  1  The  next  improvement  was  an 
endeavor  to  give  actual  and  definite 
pitch  to  the  neumes,  by  drawing  a  red, 
line  across  the  manuscript.  This  line 
which,  represented  F,  was  the  very 
beginning  of  modern  staff  notation. 
Another  line,  this  time  of  yellow  color, 
was  soon  added  above  the  red  one  ;  and 
this  later  line  was  to  represent  C. 
Soon,  the  colors  of  the  two  lines  were 
omitted,  and  the  letters  F  and  C  were 
placed  at  the  beginning  of  each  of 
them.  From  this  arose  our  F  and  C 
clefs,  which  preceded  the  G  clef  by 
some  centuries.  Hucbald,  a  monk  of 
St.  Amand,  in  Flanders,  is  said  to  have 
a  as  in  ah  ;  a  as  in  hate  ;  a  as  in  at;  e  as  in  tree  ;  e  as  in  eh  ;  i  as  in  pine  ;  1  as  in  pin;
