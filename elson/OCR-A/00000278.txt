THIRD,  MINOR 
TIERCE  DE  PICARDIE 
Third,  minor.  An  interval  measured  by 
three  half-steps. 
Third  shift.  The  double  shift  in  violin- 
playing. 
Thirteenth.  An  interval  comprising  an

diatonic  degrees,  i.e.,  thirteen  sounds. 
Thirty-second  note.  A  demisemiquaver,  ^ 
Thirty-second  rest.  A  rest,  or  pause, 
equal  to  the  length  of  a  thirty-second 
note,  q 
Thorough  bass.  Figured  bass  ;  a  system 
of  harmony  which  is  indicated  by  a 
figured  bass.  When  there  is  no  figure, 
it  is  understood  that  the  common 
chord  of  such  a  note  is  to  be  used  as 
its  harmony.  The  following  table  will 
show  the  manner  in  which  figures  are 
used  : 
The  figure  2  implies  a  4th  and  6th, 
"  "3  "a  5th  perfect, 
or  diminished,  according  to  the 
position  of  the  note  in  the  key. 
Thefigure  4  implies  a  5th,  or  5th  and  8th. 
"  "  5  "  3d  and  8th. 
«  u  g  "  3d. 
"  "  7  "  5th  and  3d. 
"  "  8  "  3d  and  5th. 
"  "  9  "  3d  and  5th. 
A  stroke  through  a  figure  directs  the 
raising  of  the  interval  by  a  natural,  or 
sharp,  as  the  case  may  be.  An  acci¬ 
dental  standing  alone  implies  a  corre¬ 
sponding  alteration  of  the  3d  of  the 
chord.  Horizontal  lines  direct  the  con¬ 
tinuance  of  the  harmony  of  the  pre¬ 
vious  chord.  If  there  are  no  figures 
under  the  previous  chord,  the  line  or 
lines  direct  the  continuance  of  the  com¬ 
mon  chord  of  the  first  note  under 
which  they  were  placed. 
Three-eighth  measure.  A  measure  hav¬ 
ing  the  value  of  three  eighth  notes, 
marked  f. 
Three  fold.  A  chord  consisting  of  three 
tones,  comprising  a  tone  combined 
with  its  third  and  fifth. 
elusive;  these  notes  are  expressed  by 
small  letters,  with  three  short  strokes, 
also  thrice-accented  octave,  or  three-lined 
octave.  See  Tablature  and  Tempera¬ 
ment. 
Thumb-string.  Melody-string  of  the 
banjo. 
Tie.  A  curved  line  placed  over  two  or 
more  notes  in  the  same  position  on  the 
stave: 
etc. 
The  tie  is  also  called  a  bind,  and"  the 
curved  line,  when  used  over  notes  repre¬ 
senting  different  sounds,  is  called  a  slur. 
(See  Slur.)  These  notes  need  not  be 
written  on  the  same  degree  of  the  staff, 
(although  they  generally  are)  for  in  the 
tempered  scale  (which  see)  the  flat  and 
the  sharp  of  two  contiguous  notes  can 
mean  the  same  sound,  and  the  follow¬ 
ing  would  therefore  be 
an  enharmonic  tie  : 
I 
If  the  two  notes  under  the  curved 
line  have  dots  above  them,  the 
curved  line  is  not  a  tie,  but  becomes- 
a  portamento  (demi-marcato)  mark. 
This  is  an  example  of  such  a  mark: 
If  the  second  note  only,  in  such  an 
example,  has  a  dot  over  it,  the  effect 
would  be  that  of  a  short  slur.  The  fol¬ 
lowing,  therefore,  would 
be  played  as  two  notes 
Threnodie  (Gr.)  (thre-«<?-de.)  )  eiegy; 
a  funeral  song. 
Threnody.  Lamentation;  a  song  of 
lamentation. 
Thrice-marked  octave.  The  name  given 
in  Germany  to  the  notes  between  the 
C  on  the  second  added  line  above  the 
treble  staff  and  the  next  B  above,  in- 
a  as  in  ah  ;  a  as  in  hate  ;  a  as  in  at;  e  as  in  tree  ;  e  as  in  eh  y  1  as  in  pine;  1  as  in  pin  y

the  first  receiving  some  degree  of

its  written  value.
