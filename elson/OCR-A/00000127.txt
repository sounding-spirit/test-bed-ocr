FINGERING,  AMERICAN 
FIORfeTTI 
J.  S.  Bach.  He  introduced  the  thumb 
freely,  and  used  the  fingers  in  a  much 
more  modern  style  than  his  predeces¬ 
sors.  He  did  not,  however,  publish 
any  system  of  fingering,  but  contented 
himself  with  teaching  the  system  to 
his  sons  and  other  pupils.  In  Philipp 
Em.  Bach's  "  Versuch  uber  die  wahre 
Art  das  Klavierzu  Spielen"  (1753),  this 
system  was  first  published.  Neverthe¬ 
less,  there  was  published,  in  England,  a 
work  on  the  same  subject,  which  ante¬ 
dates  Bach's  book.  This  is  entitled 
"  Pasquali's  Art  of  Fingering,  for  the 
Harpsichord."  In  this  (which  has  the 
numeration  o,  1,2,3,  4)>  t^le  thumb  is  as 
freely  used  as  in  modern  music.  The 
Italian  masters  undoubtedly  aided  the 
advance  in  fingering,  some  of  them 
before  the  time  of  Philipp  Em.  Bach. 
It  will  be  seen  from  the  above  that  the 
so-called  "  American  fingering  "  began 
in  Germany,  took  root  in  England,  and 
was  probably  the  earliest  numeration  of 
the  fingers.  See  English  Fingering.

Fingering,  American.  The  use  of  the 
sign  (x)  to  indicate  the  thumb  in  piano¬ 
forte  playing,  in  distinction  from  the 
German  or  foreign  fingering,  in  which 
the  thumb  is  called  the  first  finger. 
Fingering,  foreign,  >  A  method  of  fin- 
Fingering,  German,  j  gering  piano  music 
which  designates  the  thumb  as  the  first 
finger. 
Fingering,  scale.  The  system  of  scale 
fingering  at  present  in  use  is  found  in 
the  works  of  Philipp  Em.  Bach.  Yet 
the  principle  of  it  is  to  be  found  in 
some  earlier  Italian  works.  In  the  old 
spinet  and  harpsichord  works,  and  in 
an  old  organ  book  of  1571,  the  scale  was 
fingered  (German  fingering)  as  follows, 
2,  3,  2,  3,  2,  3,  2,  3—and  in  some 
later  methods  —2,  3,  4,  2,  3,  4,  2,  3. 
The  earliest  valuable  system  of  scale 
fingering  gave  the  rule  to  pass  the 
thumb  under  on  the  first  white  key 
after  a  black  one,  which  is  the  basis 
of  our  scale  fingering  to-day.  This 
would  present  such  fingerings  as  fol¬ 
lows  (Pasquali's  "Art  of  Fingering"): 
5  as  in  tone  ;  0  as  in  dove;  8  as  in  not; 
o"* 
But  in  the  right  hand,  the  fingering 
very  nearly  followed  our  present  sys¬ 
tem.  In  modern  scale  fingering  a  few 
recent  theories  may  be  mentioned  A 
few  German  pedagogues  have  endea¬ 
vored  to  change  the  accustomed  fin¬ 
gering  so  that  the  thumbs  shall  always 
fall  together,  in  both  hands.  This  has 
not  as  yet  been  accepted  as  an  advan¬ 
tageous  change.  As  an  advanced 
study,  in  difficult  fingering  many 
great  teachers,  Rosenthal  among 
others,  apply  the  fingering  of  the 
C  scale  to  many  other  scales.  To 
play  the  scale  of  D  flat  with  the  C  scale 
fingering  is  a  task  of  some  difficulty. 
Some  teachers  are  in  favor  of  ending 
each  scale  exercise  with  a  slow  trill  on 
the  last  two  notes.  This  counteracts  the 
chief  defect  of  scale  practice.  In  scale 
work  the  fingers  1,  2,  and  3,  have  the 
most  work  allotted  to  them  ;  the  fourth 
finger  is  less  used,  and  the  fifth  least 
of  all.  See  Stainer  &  Barrett,  and 
Grove's  Dictionary.
