of harmony which is indicated by a
figured bass. When there is no figure, |
it is understood that the common
chord of such a note is to be used as |
its harmony. The following table will |
show the manner in which figures are |
used :
The figure 2 implies a 4th and 6th,

under the previous chord, the line or

|Tie, A curved line placed over two or

more notes in the same position on the
stave:

 

 

   

The tie is also calléd a dzzd, and the
curved line, when used over notes repre-
senting different sounds, is called a slur.
(See Slur.) These notes need not be
written on the same degree of the staff,
(although they generally are) for in the
tempered scale (which see) the flat and
the sharp of two contiguous notes can
mean the same sound, and the follow-

ing would therefore be
an enharmonic tie:

 

If the two notes under the curved
line have dots above them, the
curved line is not a tie, but becomes.
a portamento (demi-marcato) mark.
This is an example of such a mark:

————————
E = a
———
e
If the second note only, in such an
example, has a dot over it, the effect

would be that of a short slur. The fol-
lowing, therefore, would Sage ag
be played as two notes, RQ=====

the first receiving some degree of
accent, and the second being played
with lightness, and a little shorter than
its written value.
