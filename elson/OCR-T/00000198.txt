NOTATION

 

by written or printed characters. The
earliest fixed system was that of the
Greeks (600 B. C.), which used the
letters of the alphabet, both complete
and fragmentary, to indicate different
pitches and intervals. This system,
with various changes, existed well into
the middle ages. In the earliest part
of the dark ages another system existed
contemporaneously with the employ-
ment of letters —the sewme notation.
In the zeumes, we find the beginnings
of an effort to appeal to the eye as well
as to the thought. The chief elements
of this mode of notation were the ver-
tical line | (called vvga), the dot . ,
and the horizontal line — (called
jacens ); and after these, came the up-
ward loop ~, called (plica ascendens),
and the downward loop —~ (called
plica descendens), besides a host of
other similar characters. These marks
were placed directly over each syllable ;
and while they could not give the exact
pitch to the singer, they served very
well to show the direction in which the
voice should go, and also indicated
roughly the length of the note. They
were, in short, merely a reminder to the
singer of the progressions of a melody
which he had learned orally; a species
of musical mnemonics. Theletters now
underwent a modification. A major
scale, corresponding to the diatonic
scale, which we begin on C, was repre-
sented bytheletters dB CDE FG A.
This was afterwards changed to repre-
sent a minor scale, in an effort to bring
it more in consonance with the old
Greek theory. Odo, of Cluny, is cred-
ited with making this reform during the
tenth century — our present letter sys-
tem! The next improvement was an
endeavor to give actual and definite
pitch to the neumes, by drawing a red,
line across the manuscript. This line
which, represented F, was the very
beginning of modem staff notation.
Another line, this time of yellow color,
was soon added above the red one; and
this later line was to represent C.
Soon, the colors of the two lines were
omitted, and the letters # and C were
placed at the beginning of each of
them. From this arose our F and C
clefs, which preceded the G clef by
some centuries. Hucbald, a monk of
St. Amand, in Flanders, is said to have
